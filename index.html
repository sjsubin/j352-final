    <p>Catherine Oberfield is one of many students that believes the University of Maryland could do more to prevent climate change.</p>
    <p>Trash on campus after tailgates and carbon dioxide emissions from both construction and transportation are issues the senior psychology major and environmental advocate wants the university to resolve.</p>
    <p>"Until we're at zero emissions, I personally always think the university could do more," Oberfield said.</p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-5">
            <p>In 2007, Maryland and dozens of universities nationwide signed an agreement to curb climate change and promote sustainability. The agreement, called the Carbon Commitment, led to two climate actions plans set out by Maryland in 2009 and 2017 that aimed to decrease emissions, improve energy efficiency and reach carbon neutrality by 2050.</p>
            <p>More than a decade later, officials expect the university to surpass the carbon emissions reduction goals established in 2009.</p>
            <p>An updated 2017 progress report found a 49 percent decrease in greenhouse gas reductions from 2005, just a percent shy of the 50 percent reduction goal by 2020.</p>
            <p>"Within the next month we'll conclude our greenhouse gas emissions inventory for 2018 and we anticipate that the university has achieved its 50 percent reduction, said Mark Stewart, the university's sustainability manager.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Each spring, the university collects and compiles emissions data for the previous calendar year, which is analyzed over the summer and released in the fall.</p>
    <p>In 2007, greenhouse gas emissions at UMD reached 307,542 metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to Second Nature, an organization that works with colleges and universities to enact climate action plans. These levels are equivalent to emissions released from charging approximately 39.2 billion smartphones or powering 36,827 homes a year, according to an Environmental Protection Agency equivalency calculator.</p>

    <h3>Other Universities</h3>
    <p>By 2025, the university aims to reduce these levels by 60 percent. The university has already surpassed its 25 percent reduction goal for 2015 and, in an updated 2017 progress report, the university reported a 58 percent decrease in transportation emissions since 2005.</p>
    <p>Climate change has become a growing issue nationwide. Last year, a climate report released by the U.N. found that by 2040 greenhouse emissions could warm the earth by 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit and cause food shortages, wildfires and destruction.</p>

    <p>Universities across the nation are scrambling to fight back and leading the strike against climate change by implementing action plans, improving energy efficiency and adopting recycling initiatives.</p>
    <p>In a 2019 ranking of environmentally-friendly schools by the Sierra Club, one of the country's oldest and most influential environmental advocacy organizations, UMD ranked 38th. The only other Maryland school on the list was Frostburg State University, ranked 239th.</p>
    <p>Large Maryland schools trail behind UMD in greenhouse gas reduction rates. Towson University aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent next year and by 50 percent by 2030, according to the university's webpage. University of Connecticut, another large state university, aims to decrease emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and 30 percent by 2025.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-5">
            <p>At Towson, net emissions decreased from 107,619 tons in 2007 to 61,331 metric tons in 2017, according to data compiled through an internal audit at Towson, while net emissions at University of Connecticut decreased from roughly 142,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2007 to around 120,000 tons in 2017, according to Second Nature. Emissions at UMD decreased from around 308,000 metric tons in 2007 to 177,066 metric tons in 2017.</p>
            <p>"These are serious reductions," said Josh Tulkin, director of the Maryland Sierra Club. "This is very notable and significant progress. It looks like the university has multiple strategies, which is important.</p>
            <p>Aside from the Climate Action Plan, UMD has also implemented various sustainability programs.</p>

    <h3> Making Changes</h3>
    <p>In 2018, the university secured funding to improve energy efficiency in several campus buildings including J.M Patterson Hall and Hornbake Library, which would help reduce energy use by 6 percent campus-wide. The University System of Maryland Foundation, which organizes investments for the university system, also said it would stop investing in coal, oil or natural gas companies in 2016.</p>
    <p>Student activism on campus in recent years has also triggered new initiatives. In April, dozens of students participated in the UMD Rally for Climate Justice as part of a call to take local action toward climate change. Hundreds of UMD students also participated in the global climate strike in Washington D.C. this September, according to The Diamondback.</p>
    <p>"Part of the reason that we're confident that we will meet the 50 percent benchmark is because of that student activism," Stewart said.</p>
    <p>In 2017, 86 percent of UMD's purchased power came from renewable sources and ridership of campus buses has increased by 29 percent since 2009, according to the updated progress report. The opening of the Purple Line nearby within the next few years could also help further reduce transportation pollution, Stewart added.</p>

    <p>
        <p>"If there's things that they're hiding, it would take me longer to find," said Tulkin. "I'm impressed by the diversity of projects the university is undertaking and I'm impressed by their transparency.</p>
        <p>Despite improvements, there's room for tweaking, Oberfield said. Campus-wide water consumption has increased steadily from 2015, reaching 573,415 kilogallons during the 2017-18 calendar year, according to the progress report. Solid landfilled waste increased by nearly 3,400 tons between 2014 and 2018.</p>
        <p>Oberfield thinks the university could also do more to minimize emissions from commuters, although she is generally impressed by their current agenda.</p>
        <p>For now, Stewart encourages students to continue to be conscious of their emissions.</p>
        <p class="finish">"Part of it is taking responsibility for your own energy in terms of turning off the lights when you leave your room, unplugging or turning off devices that don't need to be powered, he said. "It does genuinely help reduce energy, reduce carbon and meet our goals."</p>
